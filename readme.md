# üêç DSA Practice in Python

## üåü Overview

Welcome to the **DSA Practice in Python** repository! This collection contains comprehensive solutions and explanations for various fundamental and advanced **Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA)** problems, implemented entirely in **Python**.

This repository is designed as a study resource, with problems selected to cover key concepts frequently encountered in technical interviews.

## üìÇ Repository Structure (Topics Covered)

All solutions are provided as **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)** for interactive learning and clear visualization of code execution and results. The problems are categorized into the following folders:

| Folder Name | Description | Key Algorithms & Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `arrays_and_hashing` | Problems using lists, tuples, and fundamental techniques involving hash maps (dictionaries). | Hash Maps, Frequency Counting, Set Operations |
| `sliding_window` | Problems solving contiguous sub-array/sub-string problems efficiently. | Minimum/Maximum Substring, Dynamic Window Resizing |
| `two_pointers` | Problems that use two pointers (or indices) to traverse a data structure (usually an array or linked list). | In-Place Reversal, Sorted Array Traversal |
| `binary_search` | Implementations of binary search on sorted arrays and its common variations. | Search Space Reduction, Finding Bounds (First/Last Occurrence) |
| `linked_lists` | Operations and complex manipulations on Singly and Doubly Linked Lists. | Reversal, Merging, Cycle Detection (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare) |
| `trees` | Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and advanced tree traversals. | DFS (Pre/In/Post-order), BFS, Tree Construction |
| `graphs` | Graph traversals and standard algorithms for connected components and paths. | BFS, DFS, Topological Sort |
| `stacks` | Problems showcasing the implementation and application of the Stack data structure. | Valid Parentheses, Monotonic Stack |

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To view and run these interactive notebooks on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You need **Python 3.x** and **Jupyter Notebook** (or JupyterLab) installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Lucifer970901/DSA_in_python.git](https://github.com/Lucifer970901/DSA_in_python.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd DSA_in_python
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies** (if a `requirements.txt` file exists for libraries like `numpy` or `pandas`):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Notebooks

Start your Jupyter environment from the root directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook
